# Introduction

JavaSript implementation of feedforward neural network with backpropagarion algorithm.

## Note
    
This project is still in development phase. Further development should bring extended  description, add more use cases and involve code refactoring and optimalisation.

P.S. Sorry for my english. If You wish to help me with this project or correct my english description - You are welcome :)

# Requirements
 
   * node js - Basically this is not strong requirement. There is no problem to run this library in modern browser. I decide to use node.js because there is more CPU power to use by JavaScript

   
# Demo
